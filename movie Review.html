<p><u><b style="font-size: 20px;">storyline:</b></u><br><br>A middle-aged school teacher, Gandhi Mahaan, embarks on a journey of self-discovery after getting abandoned by his family. He soon becomes a pride billionaire but faces many challenges.</p>
<p><u><b style="font-size: 20px;">Review:</b></u><br><br>Mahaan is a solid, very well-written, slow-paced, stylishly shot, and neatly executed Gangster Drama. A typical Karthik Subbaraj film with the gangster setup, well-defined characters, plot twists, and retro cars. With a familiar setup, he has corrected the things which went wrong in (Jagame Thandhiram), which is energy in the screenplay. Unlike that film, this film has infectious energy and liveliness in the screenplay which helped keep things engaging throughout the 162 minutes. A pretty well-established first half followed by a decent second half. There are some pacing issues with the film that could easily trim 15-20 minutes from its runtime. The 3rd act twist is predictable but nonetheless is anchored effortlessly by Vikram. That single-take action sequence by him blew my mind away and reminded me of (Kingsman's - The Church Fight sequence). Dhruv Vikram is quite good for his age, superb effort. The father-son confrontation and the mind game in the climax is a scream! All in All, Mahaan is a thoroughly enjoyable masala entertainer which has all the elements to keep you invested in its runtime. Father and son going against each other put up a terrific show that shouldn't be missed. DO WATCH IT.</p>
<p><u><b style="font-size: 20px;">Highlights:</b></u><br><br>The film opens with this Mohandas Gandhi quote: ‚ÄúFreedom is not worth having if it does not include the freedom to make mistakes.‚Äù What follows is the story of someone named Gandhi Mahaan (Vikram), who ends up making mistakes with a capital M.</p>
<p><q>Finally Mahaan can easily be said as a comeback for vikram after continious disasters üí• A Normal revenge emotional action drama with a unique screenplay pattern makes the film intresting and keeps us engaging charecters are never left incomplete He puts words in the mouth of Sathyavan, calling his friend a guardian angel, a Jesus reincarnate if you will. In the climax, Gandhi Mahaan literally reads out the quote that was flashed at the beginning of the film.</q></p>
